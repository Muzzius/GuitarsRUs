# GuitarsRUs

## Introduction
This is a very simple site I created as part of a course to show my understanding of bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/.
It is a very simple site displaying a guitar store. None of the buttons are functional.

## Installation
Download the files to wherever you would like on your pc.

## Usage
If you open the index.html folder using a browser it will display the site, it should look like this:

When you hover of the images there is a darkening effect and it will diplay the name of the guitar and a price.
